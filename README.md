# Guilloché Animator

Generating some spirography (Hypotrochoid, Epitrochoid or Hypocycloid) and make possible animation. 


## How it works.

The first step is to create a HTML5 canvas.
The second step is to draw the figure, but how exactly to draw the figure ? We have to know, what's a spirograph. At this time, the script only allow to make an Hypotrochoid, Epitrochoid or an Hypocycloid. So let's go to understand how draw a Hypotrochoid.

### Hypotrochoid

So, this is, visually how it works. Now, lets do it by math. 

Not reinvent the wheel. So open your favorite search-engine and check more about " hypotrochoid ", we immediatly falling on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotrochoid). 

The radius of the biggest circle will be called `major`.
The radius of the internal circle will be called `minor`.
The point attached to the internal circle is to a distance d from the center of this same internal circle. Let's call it `radius`.

On wikipedia, we have our equation, so replace it with our notation :

In loop, we will draw it progressively, for each new incrementation, we change (photo de theta) 


Set the value you want, and you can get something like that :

### Epitrochoid

Same for epitrochoid

Set the value value you want, and you can get something like that :

### Hypocycloid

Same for hypocycloid

Set the value you want, and you can get something like that : (inclure photo d'un résultat)
